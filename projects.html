<h2>10TH GRADE PERSONAL PROJECT</h2>
<p>For my 10th grade Personal Project, I explored the area of fashion design, taking the role of a fashion designer and designing my own dress. Below are some of my sketches as part of my brainstorming.</p>

<h3>The Cut and Design Process</h3>
<p>I purchased my fabric and embellishments from a fabric store in Chicago called Fishman's Fabrics. They have an extremely wide selection of fabrics, from faux fur for coats to lace for wedding dresses, it's definitely a store you might want to go to if you love to design clothing!
<p>FUN FACT! SAIC or the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, is one of America's largest accredited independent schools of art and design. According to one of my good friends, who is an alumni of SAIC, most of the students in the fashion design department purchase their fabrics from Fishman's.
